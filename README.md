# FaIR Climate Model Emulator
Erica Simon, Climate Risk Intern

January to March 2024

## Project Summary
This repository contains code to setup FaIR in a manner that reproduces historical warming trends and is optimized for probabilistic runs under different policy scenarios, which are formulized as emissions trajectories. Additionally, it contains methods to visualize key outputs of FaIR with a focus on the high-end tail of the distribution (95th percentile).

## Recommended Workflow
`FAIR/examples/basic_run_example.ipynb`
I've added a submodule that links to a repo owned by Dr. Chris Smith, the main creator of FaIR. The examples directory is very useful i
